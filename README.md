# standardnotes-fs

## Description
Mount your [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) account as a filesystem and edit your notes as plain text files.

This allows you to edit your notes in your favorite text editor, use standard \*nix programs and Bash scripts to manipulate them, or back them up with rsync.

This is an _unofficial_ Standard Notes client.

## Example

```text
$ snfs ~/notes
Please enter your Standard Notes username: tanner@example.com
Please enter your password (hidden): 

$ tree --dirsfirst ~/notes
/home/tanner/notes

$ rsync -Wa ~/notes/ ~/notes_backup/

## Notes
* Important: standardnotes-fs has not been tested vigorously yet. Before you use it, please make a backup of your notes by selecting `Account > Download Data Archive` in the official Standard Notes client.
* Your account password is not stored and the Python variable is deleted after your encryption keys are generated with it.
* Your account's encryption keys are stored in a config file on disk. This can be disabled with `--no-config-file`.
* By default the client syncs with the Standard Notes server every 30 seconds and after any note modifications are saved.
* If connection to the server is lost, it will keep trying to sync periodically.
* Filesystem functions currently supported: getattr, readdir, read, truncate, write, create, unlink, utimens, and rename.
* Creating hidden files (names beginning with a period) is disabled to prevent junk file creation.
* Notes with identical names are deduplicated by adding a number to the end.
* On the filesystem, notes will have the '.txt' extension appended to their name. '/' is replaced with '-'.
