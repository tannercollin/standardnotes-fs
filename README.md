# standardnotes-fs

:warning: **Project archived**: Due to changes in the Standard Notes API and encryption, this program will no longer work.

## Description
Mount your [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) account as a filesystem and edit your notes as plain text files.

This allows you to edit your notes in your favorite text editor, use standard \*nix programs and Bash scripts to manipulate them, or back them up with rsync.

This is an _unofficial_ Standard Notes client.

**Important:** standardnotes-fs only works with protocol version 003 accounts. It's unlikely I'll add 004 support, so don't upgrade your account if you want to use this.

## Example

```text
$ snfs notes/
Please enter your Standard Notes username: tanner@example.com
Please enter your password (hidden): 
Enter your two-factor authentication code: 123456

## Notes
* Important: standardnotes-fs has not been tested vigorously yet. Before you use it, please make a backup of your notes by selecting `Account > Download Data Archive` in the official Standard Notes client.
* Your account password is not stored and the Python variable is deleted after your encryption keys are generated with it.
* Your account's encryption keys are stored in a config file on disk. This can be disabled with `--no-config-file`.
* By default the client syncs with the Standard Notes server every 30 seconds and after any note modifications are saved.
* If connection to the server is lost, it will keep trying to sync periodically.
* Creating hidden files (names beginning with a period) is disabled to prevent junk file creation.
* Notes with identical names are deduplicated by adding a number to the end.
* On the filesystem, notes will have the '.txt' extension appended to their name. Change this with the `--ext` argument. Example: `--ext '.md'`.
* neovim/nvim users have had errors about nvim being "unable to create backup file" when writing. This is a bug with neovim. Executing `mkdir ~/.local/share/nvim/backup` might fix it.

## Development

Install dependencies:
```text
$ sudo apt install fuse python3 python3-pip python-virtualenv python3-virtualenv
$ sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
```

$ cd standardnotes-fs
$ virtualenv -p python3 env
$ . env/bin/activate
(env) $ pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir .
```

Standardnotes-fs is now installed in the virtual environment. Run it:
